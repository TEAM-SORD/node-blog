# Week 7: build a blog using node.js

Clone the [Starter kit](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/elevator-mechanic).

The blog should have the following elements:

* Submission of new blog entries
* Viewing of existing entries
* Editing of existing blog entries
* Listing of all blog entries

You should build your blog step by step, as follows:

* Write acceptance tests
* Build a JSON API using RESTful routes
* Save and retrieve entries using a database
* Add HTML pages using templates

As stretch goals, you should look at adding:
* Editing and deleting of entries
* User registration
* Caching
* Logging
* Rich-text editing
